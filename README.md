# CAPTCHA Solver

This web application allows users to input the URL of a captcha image and attempts to solve it automatically.

## Features
- Enter a captcha image URL (default or custom).
- Sends the image URL to a backend API that processes and returns the captcha solution.
- Displays the solved captcha text to the user.

## How to Run
1. Save all files in a directory.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter the URL of a captcha image in the input box or use the default.
4. Click 'Solve Captcha' to see the solution.

> Note: This implementation sends requests to `https://api.example.com/solve-captcha`, which is a placeholder. Replace it with the actual captcha solving API endpoint.

## Note
- This is a simple demonstration. For production, implement proper error handling and security measures.
